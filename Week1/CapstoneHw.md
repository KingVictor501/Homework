# **Definition Statement**
I want to build a web application that can be used to locate food trucks
# Definition of Audience
The users of my application will be people looking for food trucks within walking distance of their work locations.

My web app will be used to help hungry downtown workers
that enjoy eating food trucks. The app will be exclusive to downtown
areas, during typical lunch hours.

### Each page will have the following
- Header
- Navigation
- Logo
- Header CTA
- Hamburger Nav on Mobile
- Color Pallet:

- Font: Open Sans,Arial,sans-serif


### Homepage
- Hero Section
- How to use section
- Call to Action

### Directory
- Listings of Food Trucks


### About
- Images in the context of about page
- contact form at the bottom

### FAQ
- How to use
- Is it free
- How do I get listed

## Research

### Existing Sites
[Food Trucks in](https://www.foodtrucksin.com/truck-search)

[Street Food Finder](https://streetfoodfinder.com/c/FL/Tampa)

Both site feel cluttered and seems to have too many steps. I feel that my app may be advantageous because I am targeting a particular audience.
